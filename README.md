# Imp-C-Programs
This repository contains the important C problems that I came across while practicing C language on certain platforms like hackerrank.com or the books itself or the college exams or the challenges. I may refer to them when I get stuck in some bigger problem as these may serve the base idea to solve the bigger problem. This is public so that people can help me improve my codes; if anybody cares and bothers, of course. This might actually contain mostly basic problems that I consider to be important enough to refer to in the future.
